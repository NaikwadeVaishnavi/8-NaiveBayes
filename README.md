This repository contains datasets and implementations related to Naive Bayes classification, a popular algorithm in machine learning used for classification tasks.
## Naive Bayes Algorithm

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. Despite its "naive" assumption, Naive Bayes has shown to be surprisingly effective in many real-world applications, especially in document classification and spam filtering.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Clean the dataset by removing noise, irrelevant information, and handling missing values.
   - Convert categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

2. **Training:**
   - Estimate the probability distributions of features for each class in the training dataset.
   - Calculate the prior probabilities of each class.

3. **Prediction:**
   - For a given instance with feature values, calculate the posterior probability of each class using Bayes' theorem.
   - Select the class with the highest posterior probability as the predicted class for the instance.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess the performance of the Naive Bayes classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Validate the model using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness.
