<h1>Naive Bayes Algorithm</h1>

Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.

<strong>Steps to implement:</strong><br>

1. Data Pre-processing step<br>
2. Fitting Naive Bayes to the Training set<br>
3. Predicting the test result<br>
4. Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix)<br>
5. Visualizing the test set result.<br>
